Report only real issues:
- something on the sheet that conflicts with a requirement in the excerpts;
- something the excerpts require on this kind of sheet that is clearly missing from it;
- a plain inconsistency within the sheet (for example, a value stated two different ways), only when you're sure.

Don't report topics the excerpts don't cover, drafting style, or anything you can't read with confidence. A few well-founded issues are better than many weak ones, and an empty list is a good answer when the sheet is fine. Quote the sheet and the manual precisely in the detail.`;
